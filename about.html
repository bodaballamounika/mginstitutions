        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>An institution is a social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live.</p>
        <p>An institution has a purpose. Institutions are permanent, which means that they do not end when one person is gone. An institution has rules and can enforce rules of human behavior. The word "institution" can be used in two ways. It can mean a very broad idea, or a very "specific" (narrow) one.</p>

        <h2>Founder</h2>
        <h2><b>Dr.Gettam Gandhi Raj</b></h1>
        <p>Dr.Gettam Gandhi Raj is regarded as one of the pioneering forces in teaching and learning in contemporary India. In recent decades, academicians and educationists have been able to bring a striking shift from inaccessible and archaic academic setups in Indian schools and colleges. Dr. Gandhi's commitment to qualitatively change the previous scenario into a dynamic and systematic learning environment has, in fact, provided the impetus for this shift in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and beyond.

            Since 1986, Dr.Gandhi has worked towards a seamless integration of learning made accessible and knowledge made attainable. His ideology and vision are to ensure that every student is provided with the foundation, the capabilities and the means to achieve rigour, skill and, ultimately, success. The <b>M&G</b> Group of Educational Institutions is an embodiment of this noble vision.</p>

            <p>Hailing from the town of Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Dr.Gandhi is a post graduate gold medalist in computer science and has a Ph.D in information systems from Kingston UNiversity,London-UNITED KINGDOM. His humble beginnings as a coaching teacher in computer science reflects his passion to education and helping young students succeed. His dedication and persistence with the occupation led to the conception of <b>M&G </b>Schools, Colleges and Hospitals. Today, they stand as some of the most preferred schooling and training destinations across the country.

                Dr. Gandhi combines his intellectual prowess as an entrepreneur and integrity as a public servant to the best of his abilities, and is working towards building a technologically driven and environmentally sustainable capital city for the people of Andhra Pradesh.
